## Where is the Project ID in Jira?
You can find it directly from the link you use to view Jira, for example:  
example-link-jira.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/<mark>PROJECTID</mark>/boards/1  
Here, the Project ID is immediately after /projects/

## Where to get the Jira API Token?
To get the API Token, you need to be an administrator of the organization in Jira. If you are an administrator, follow [this tutorial from Jira](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/). Below is a simplified version:

1. Log in to https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens.
2. Click on Create API token.
3. In the dialog that appears, enter a name for your token and click Create.
4. Click Copy to clipboard.
5. Congratulations, you have your API Token.

## Where to find the Project Link?
You can get it directly from the link you use to view Jira, for example:  
<mark>https:/example-link-jira.atlassian.net</mark>/jira/software/projects/PROJECTID/boards/1  
Here, we only take the main part of the link.
