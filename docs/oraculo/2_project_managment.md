## 🧩 Project Model Canvas

### 🔍 Justifications
1. LEDS mentors have difficulty discovering the efficiency of students in completing tasks.  
2. Students lack a platform to check tasks and have them assigned.  
3. The repository analysis process is time-consuming when done manually.

---

### 🎯 Product
A chatbot to assist in managing LEDS projects.

---

### 🧠 SMART Goal
Collect data from GitHub repositories and Discord conversations to create a chatbot that provides real-time information about the LEDS project progress.

---

### ✅ Requirements
- Friendly interface;  
- Extract data from GitHub repositories;  
- Extract information from Discord workgroup conversations;  
- Automate analysis of team and individual performance.

---

### 🎁 Benefits
- Display team performance in sprint progress;  
- Improve decision-making;  
- Check individual performance metrics.

---

### 👥 External Stakeholders & Factors
Advisors, scholarship holders, staff, and other stakeholders involved in LEDS and FAPES.

---

### 🔮 Assumptions
- Team commitment.  
- Knowledge of the required technologies.

---

### ⚠️ Risks

#### 1. Requirement changes during the project  
- **Probability**: 20%  
- **Mitigation**: Ensure a solid requirements phase and allow flexibility in development to accommodate changes.

#### 2. Lack of technical knowledge  
- **Probability**: 60%  
- **Mitigation**: Allocate time during sprints for learning and mastery.

#### 3. Team member time constraints  
- **Probability**: 80%  
- **Mitigation**: Coordinate schedules and design viable sprints based on available time.

### 🧱 Team Topology

**Platform Team**  
Enables stream-aligned teams to deliver work autonomously. While stream-aligned teams maintain full ownership of their work, the platform team provides internal services and tools to support delivery.

---

### 📦 Deliverables

#### Management:
- **Sprint 1**: PMC and documentation  
- **Sprint 2**: Technology research and metric definition  
- **Sprints 3, 4, 5, 6**: Results with collected metrics  
- **Sprints 7 and 8**: Automated metrics and performance report

#### Developers:
- **Sprint 1**: Architectural documentation  
- **Sprint 2**: Implementation of discussed technologies  
- **Sprints 3, 4, 5**: Code improvements and documentation  
- **Sprints 7 and 8**: Functional and documented application

---

### ⛓ Constraints
- Must use LangChain, DevLake, n8n, SonarQube, and OpenWebUI  
- Dependent on AWS Marketplace / VSC environment  
- Delivery deadline: 3 months
