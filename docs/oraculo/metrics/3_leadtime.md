# Lead Time

### ðŸ§¾ Definition:

The total time taken from the moment a task is requested (created) to the moment it is completed (delivered).

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:

To evaluate the end-to-end efficiency of the process and understand how long stakeholders wait for a feature or task.

### ðŸ§® Calculation Method:

Subtract the task creation date from the completion date.  
- **Formula:**  
`Lead Time = Completion date - Creation date`

### ðŸ“Š How will we measure in the project?

Measurement will be based on data from GitHub Projects, considering the total time between the opening of an issue and its closure. This time represents the full work cycle for each item. Monitoring will be continuous, and the data will be analyzed at the end of each sprint, making it possible to evaluate the average delivery time for demands.

### ðŸŒŸ Project impact:

Lead time provides a clear view of the delivery process's agility. By tracking this metric, it becomes possible to identify delays, understand where bottlenecks occur, and improve delivery predictability. This strengthens commitment to deadlines, increases transparency with stakeholders, and supports decision-making to optimize the teamâ€™s workflow.
