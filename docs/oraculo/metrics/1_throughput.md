# Throughput
### ðŸ§¾ Definition:

The number of work items (e.g., issues, tasks, user stories) completed within a given time frame (usually a sprint or week).

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:

To measure the productivity of the team by tracking how many tasks are delivered over time.

### ðŸ§® Calculation Method:

Count the number of completed items during a specific time period.

- **Formula:**  
`Throughput = Number of items completed / Time period`

### ðŸ“Š How will we measure it in the project?

Measurement will be based on data from GitHub Projects, counting the number of completed (closed) issues in each sprint. Monitoring will be continuous, and the results will be consolidated at the end of each development cycle, allowing us to identify the actual delivery volume of the team.

### ðŸŒŸ Project impact:

Throughput provides a clear view of the teamâ€™s productivity, helping to determine the ideal amount of work per sprint. By tracking this metric, it is possible to identify performance trends, adjust team capacity, and detect workflow bottlenecks. This directly contributes to more accurate planning and continuous improvement of project processes.
