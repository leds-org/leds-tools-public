# Cycle Time

### ðŸ§¾ Definition:

The time taken to actively work on a task, from the moment work starts until it is completed.

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:

To analyze how long the team takes to process tasks once they begin working on them, helping to optimize internal workflow.

### ðŸ§® Calculation Method:

Subtract the task start date (when work begins) from the completion date.  
- **Formula:**  
`Cycle Time = Completion date - Start of work date`

> ðŸ”Ž Note: Cycle Time is always â‰¤ Lead Time.

### ðŸ“Š How will we measure in the project?

The measurement will be based on data from GitHub Projects, calculating the time it takes from the start of work on an issue to its completion (closure). This time covers the active development phase, without considering periods of waiting or inactivity. The analysis will be continuous, and the results will be reviewed at the end of each sprint to identify variations in development time.

### ðŸŒŸ Project impact:

Cycle time is an essential metric for evaluating the efficiency of the development process. By monitoring it, the team can identify where delays are occurring in the workflow and adjust processes to reduce cycle time. This results in faster deliveries and helps increase the teamâ€™s ability to handle more tasks simultaneously, optimizing the overall project performance.
