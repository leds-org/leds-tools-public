# BurnUp

### ðŸ§¾ Definition:

A visual tool that shows the amount of work completed over time compared to the total work planned.

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:

To track progress toward a goal, visualize scope changes, and understand if the team is on track to meet deadlines.

### ðŸ§® Calculation Method:

- **X-axis:** Time (e.g., sprints or days)  
- **Y-axis:** Work items (e.g., number of issues or story points)  
- Plot two lines:
  - **Completed work line:** Cumulative count of completed items.
  - **Total work line:** Constant or adjusted if scope changes.

### ðŸ“Š How will we measure in the project?

We will use data from GitHub Projects for measurement, monitoring the number of open and closed issues over time. Thus, the Burnup chart will be built based on the accumulation of closed issues in relation to the total planned for each sprint.

### ðŸŒŸ Project impact:

The Burnup allows us to compare the flow of incoming issues in the project with their resolution, evaluating the development team's ability to complete tasks within the expected timeframe. From this metric, it's possible to estimate a satisfactory volume of new issues to be defined in a sprint and to identify deviations such as delays or an increase in tasks.
