This metamodel defines the structure of a "Made" system, which consists of several key components used in project management, such as projects, teams, processes, backlogs, and timeboxes. Below is a breakdown of the elements and their relationships:

```mermaid

    }

    class Process {

        <<import>>
    }

    Model --> Project
    Model --> Team
    Model --> Process
    Model --> Backlog
    Model --> TimeBox
    Model --> Roadmap
    Model --> Helpers
    Model --> Terminals


```
### Model (Entry Point)
The `Model` serves as the main entry point for the grammar. It consists of one mandatory `Project` and multiple optional components, which can include teams, processes, backlogs, and timeboxes.

### Components
- **Project**: A required element in the `Model`, representing the central project that the other components relate to. This element is imported from the `projects` package.
- **Team**: Represents teams working within the project. This is an optional component that can be added to the `Model` and is imported from the `team` package.
- **Process**: Represents processes within the project. Like teams, it is an optional component and is imported from the `processes` package.
- **Backlog**: Refers to the backlog of tasks or issues in the project. It is also optional and is imported from the `backlog` package.
- **TimeBox**: Represents time-based elements like sprints or deadlines. It is an optional component imported from the `timebox` package.
- **Roadmap**: Represents strategic planning elements with milestones and releases. It is an optional component imported from the `roadmap` package.

###  Supporting Packages
The model also relies on some supporting packages, including:
- **Helpers**: A package for utility or supporting elements.
- **Terminals**: Another supporting package, possibly used for defining basic terminal elements in the grammar.


## Project

The `Project` class defines the main entity, containing several key attributes:
- **name**: A string representing the name of the project.
- **email**: A string for the email address associated with the project.
- **host**: A string that represents the host where the project is located.
- **token**: A string used for authentication or access within the project.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Project {
        +STRING name
        +STRING email
        +STRING host
        +STRING token
    }
    
    class Identification {
        <<import>>
    }

    class Description {
        <<import>>
    }

    Project *-- Identification
    Project *-- Description

```

In addition to these attributes, the `Project` class is linked to two important components:

### Identification Component
The `Identification` component represents a part of the project that is responsible for managing project identification. The details of this component are imported from external sources (`terminals` or `helpers`), and it is considered essential for the overall structure of the project.

### Description Component
The `Description` component handles descriptive information related to the project. Like the `Identification` component, its details are imported from external sources, making it an integral part of the project structure.

## Team

This class diagram represents the structure of a Team Management system, focusing on the `Team` and `TeamMember` classes. It outlines the attributes of each class and the relationship between them.
