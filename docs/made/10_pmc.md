# Project Model Canvas

## Justifications (Past)
- Low visibility of priorities and progress  
- Difficulty adapting quickly to scope changes  
- Rework and delivery delays due to lack of standardization  
- Repetitive effort configuring sprints, backlogs, and releases  


## SMART Objectives
- **Reduce by 50 %** the average sprint-planning time  
- **Decrease by 30 %** the occurrences of rework caused by manual processes and lack of standardization  
- **Increase by 100 %** transparency about progress and priorities for all stakeholders  


## Benefits (Future)
- **Faster deliveries:** shorter development cycles and releases, accelerating time-to-market  
- **Rework reduction:** artifact and “as-code” workflow standardization cuts errors and rework by up to 30 %  
- **Greater transparency:** real-time visibility of backlog, sprints, and task status for all stakeholders  
- **Planning optimization:** automation of repetitive tasks reduces sprint-organization time by up to 50 %  


## Product
- **Agile-Management Modules:** definition and management of EPICs, user stories, and tasks via DSL  
- **Integrated Backlog:** product and sprint backlogs prioritized and accessible to everyone  
- **Sprint Planning:** configurable time-boxes with automatic assignment of owners  
- **Reusable Workflows & Templates:** parameterized templates for EPICs, stories, and processes (review, deploy)  
- **Dashboards & Metrics:** burndown, velocity, and quality indicators for continuous monitoring  


## Requirements
1. Team registration with roles, skills, and competencies to allocate resources efficiently  
2. Versioned release roadmap linking EPICs and user stories to versions, with planned start and end dates  
3. Reusable workflows and templates for common processes (code review, design approval, deploy) ensuring standardization and rapid setup  
4. Dashboards and metrics (burndown, velocity, quality indicators) for real-time tracking of progress and performance  
5. Full history and traceability of all definitions (versioned management artifacts) for audits and lessons learned  
6. Role-based access control, ensuring proper visibility and security for each stakeholder  
7. Integration with testing and CI/CD tools, enabling continuous quality control and automated validation before each release  


## External Stakeholders
- Executive Sponsor  
- Project Manager  
- Product Owner  
- Scrum Master  
- Development Team  
- QA / Testing Team

- **Stable MADE Platform:** tool available and performant for modeling EPICs, stories, sprints, and releases without interruptions  
- **Support & Training:** Gamma team available to answer initial questions and provide training  


## Risks

|------------------------------------------------------|:------:|---------------------------------------------------|
| Students drop the course                             |  7/10  | Assign pairs to carry out the activities          |
| Scheduling conflicts among team members              |  8/10  | Organize efficient communication channels         |
