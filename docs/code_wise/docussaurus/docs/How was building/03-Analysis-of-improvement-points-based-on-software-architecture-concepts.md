## Scalability:
System ability to handle increased load without losing performance.

### Problems:
- Analysis of PRs done synchronously and sequentially (one at a time).
- Coupled code that makes parallelism or use in multiple instances difficult.

### Solutions
- Use processing queues (e.g. RabbitMQ, Redis, Celery) to handle many PRs at the same time.
- Run parallel workers to process multiple PRs simultaneously.
- Store analysis results in cache or database to avoid unnecessary reprocessing.
- Structure the Model to process multiple files in a distributed or asynchronous manner.

## Maintainability:
Ease of understanding, modifying and evolving the system over time

### Problems:
- Code with mixed responsibilities (e.g. analysis logic within the controller).
- Lack of modularization of analysis rules.
- Lack of standardization for adding new sources (like Slack, GitLab, etc.).

### Solutions:
- Separate each layer well in MVC, avoiding mixing responsibilities.
- Create independent modules for each type of validation (e.g. style, security, performance).
- Use clear interfaces between layers, which allows you to change implementations without affecting the rest of the system.
- Document rules and flows to facilitate onboarding of new devs.

## Testability:
Ability to test the system in a simple, isolated and reliable way.

### Problems:
- Coupled code with side effects (e.g. performs analysis and sends comments to GitHub in the same method).
- Lack of dependency injection (e.g. external APIs hardcoded in the code).
- Difficulty simulating scenarios without making real calls.

### Solutions:
- Separate business logic from code that interacts with external services.
- Use dependency injection so you can mock external calls.
- Create unit tests for each module (mainly Model ones).
- Have automated test coverage in Controllers.

## Performance:
How quickly and efficiently the system responds to operations.

### Problems: 
- Reanalyze all code with each PR, even if changes are small.
- Calling the Gemini API (or other agent) for each file separately (high cost and latency).
- Making unnecessary GitHub API calls.

### Solutions:
- Incremental analysis, where actually modified files are processed.
- Group code snippets by context before sending to the agent, reducing calls.
- Cache the results of repeated analyzes.
- Monitor call response times and identify bottlenecks.
