## Project Model Canvas (PMC)

### Justification  
Software developers face slow manual feedback cycles, difficulty identifying performance issues, accumulated technical debt, and a lack of reliable indicators to support code quality improvements.

### SMART Objective  
Develop and launch the CodeWise API within 3 months, with an 8-person team, to increase productivity and delivery quality by providing automated feedback and statistical insights.

### Final Product  
An API developed using FastAPI, integrated with OpenAI GPT-3 to analyze code in Python, C#, and Java. The API provides documented endpoints (Swagger/OpenAPI), real-time consultations, and performance and quality reports.

### Benefits  
- Automated code review generation  
- Reliable statistics on technical debt  
- Proven quality improvement in deliveries, supported by literature and team data  
- Direct impact on developer productivity

### Requirements  
- FastAPI and Python 3.x  
- Integration with the OpenAI GPT-3 API  
- Support for analyzing code in Python, C#, and Java  
- Docker containerization  
- Secure management of access keys and data

### External Stakeholders and Influencing Factors  
- Developers at LEDS  
- Developers and companies seeking to improve code quality  
- Open source communities and tech forums

### Premises  
- The development team has knowledge of Python and FastAPI  
- The project management team is familiar with delivery monitoring tools

### Constraints  
- OpenAI API limitations (rate limits and code size)  
- Strict security requirements for API keys and access credentials  
- Budget and delivery deadline limited to 3 months

### Risks  
- **External Dependency**: Reliance on the OpenAI API (risk of rate limits or downtime)  
- **Feedback Accuracy**: Possibility of imprecise suggestions from GPT-3  
- **Probability**: Moderate, due to integration complexity and request volume  
- **Mitigation Actions**: Continuous monitoring, robust testing, fallback plans; acceptance of potential limitations

### Team  
- **Project Management (GPS students)**: Planning, monitoring, coordination, and communication  
- **Development (Systems Project students)**: Coding, testing, deployment, and documentation

### Cost Estimate  
- **Team Load**: 8 people × 8 hours/week = 64 hours/week  
- **Rate per Hour** (Pleno Developer avg.): R$ 80/hour  
- **Estimated Weekly Cost**: 64 × R$ 80 = R$ 5,120  
- **Estimated Total over 12 Weeks**: R$ 61,440

### Team Topology  
- This project follows a **Platform Team** model.  
  The CodeWise team provides internal services and tools to **Stream-Aligned Teams** (e.g., the IT development teams), who deliver value directly to end users.  
  CodeWise supports them by enhancing the quality and efficiency of their code through automated analysis.

- **Month 3**: Dashboard, final testing, documentation, beta release

## Team Topology

Our team follows the **Platform Team** topology model.

The CodeWise project is being developed by a platform team composed of the following members:

### 📌 Platform Team – CodeWise Project

#### Project Management
- **Perceu Oliveira**
- **Miguel Malini**
- **João Ferrareis**
- **Wal Candeia**

#### Systems and Development
- **Arthur Miguel**
- **Michele Altavilla**
- **Bernardo Rosa**
- **Gabriel Brito**
---

The CodeWise project is being developed by a platform team because our main customer is an internal client — specifically, the software development teams within the IT department. These internal teams are responsible for delivering direct value to end users and are aligned with the **Stream-Aligned Team** topology.

In this context, CodeWise serves as a **support tool** that enhances the efficiency and quality of the code produced by stream-aligned teams. It operates by analyzing already-written code and offering suggestions for improvements, thus contributing indirectly to the final value delivery.

This separation allows the Platform Team (CodeWise team) to focus on building and maintaining a reusable service that empowers and accelerates the work of Stream-Aligned Teams.

## Communication Plan

### Communication Platform

The team has chosen **Telegram** as the primary communication platform. While Discord is often used in other campus projects, it tends to mix with personal chats. Telegram ensures that messages remain visible, organized, and free from unrelated content.

### Telegram Groups

Two distinct Telegram groups have been created:

1. **Management Group**  
   A private group that includes only the four members of the **Project Management Team**. This space is used for internal coordination, defining responsibilities, sharing feedback, and planning deliveries. It is not divided into topics.

2. **General Project Group**  
   This group includes all eight members from both the **Management** and **Project & Systems** teams. Inside this group, Telegram's **topic/thread feature** is used to organize communication into specific areas:

   - **General Discussion**: For daily conversation, updates, clarifying doubts, and discussing ideas between all members.
   - **Useful Links**: A dedicated topic to store and share project materials such as:
     - Google Drive links (e.g., drafts before publishing in Docusaurus)
     - GitHub repository (CodeWise)
     - Additional documentation or resources
   - **Announcements**: A focused topic for important messages like meeting schedules, professor feedback, or deadline changes.
   - **Frontend Discussion**: For questions, suggestions, and discussions specific to frontend development.
   - **Backend Discussion**: For backend-related planning, architecture, and problem-solving.

### Weekly Meetings

The team meets weekly with all project members every **Monday afternoon** (or **Tuesday if Monday is a holiday),** right before the regular class session with the Systems Project professor. This scheduling allows real-time integration of the professor's feedback into project planning.

**Common discussion topics in weekly meetings include:**

- Reviewing weekly progress and goals
- Aligning management and technical expectations
- Identifying blockers or dependencies
- Updating responsibilities and delivery timelines
- Syncing project documentation status
- Discussing professor or stakeholder feedback
- Planning upcoming tasks and priorities
