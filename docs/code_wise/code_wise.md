title: Code Wise

**Code Wise** is a Visual Studio Code extension that automatically **analyzes** your codebase at pre-commit, leveraging state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, Ollama, Mistral, and others. It helps developers identify **architectural** improvements, **SOLID** principle violations, **code smells**, and suggest **design patterns** — all seamlessly integrated into their daily workflow.

### Overview

Once installed and configured, CodeWise operates silently in the background. It monitors your Git repository for new commits and automatically triggers a set of intelligent agents that review the code changes, offering structured, insightful feedback saved directly into your workspace.


1. Install the extension locally
2. Configure your .env file with the appropriate LLM credentials:
    (name of your provider)_API_KEY=your-api-key (ex. GEMINI_API_KEY)
    MODEL=your-model-name
    PROVIDER=gemini 
    - Supported providers:
        openai

        google (Gemini)

        groq

        ollama

        mistral

        cohere

        anthropic

        together  

3. Ensure your project has the necessary dependencies:
    * "@types/node": "20.x"
    * "typescript": "^5.8.3"
    * "node.js": "^v20.18.0"
    * "npm": "^11.4.1"
    * Visual Studio Code (v1.85+)

### How to Use

This action runs automatically on every commit. It analyzes code files changed in the commit and sends a file (commit_analysis_report.md) with analysis about performance and code smell suggestions to the root of projects. 

### Workflow Breakdown

The following steps describe the internal process behind CodeWise:

1. **Git Commit Detection**  
   CodeWise watches the `.git/logs/HEAD` file to detect when a new commit is made. This enables real-time, non-intrusive monitoring of commit activity without requiring Git hooks.

2. **Extract Commit Information**  
   Once a commit is detected, the system extracts:
   - Commit hash, author, date, and message
   - Changed files and corresponding diffs

   This information is formatted and saved in a temporary file (`gitInput.txt`) to serve as input for the language models.

3. **Invoke LLM Agents in Parallel**  
   CodeWise leverages a set of specialized agents (built on top of LangChain + LangGraph), each trained to analyze a specific dimension of the codebase:
   - **Architect Agent**: Analyzes folder structure and determines the architectural pattern used (e.g., MVC, Clean Architecture).
   - **Integration Agent**: Reviews module coupling and suggests integration improvements.
   - **SOLID Agent**: Detects violations of SOLID principles and proposes corrections.
   - **Framework Analyst**: Suggests alternative frameworks or improvements in the usage of existing ones.
   - **Design Pattern Advisor**: Recommends design patterns suitable for scalability, reusability, or maintainability.

4. **Merge Results into Markdown Report**  
   The results from all LLMs are aggregated into a structured markdown report (`commit_analysis_report.md`), which includes individual sections for each agent’s findings.

5. **Clean Up and Await Next Commit**  
   After the report is generated, temporary files are deleted and the extension continues monitoring for future commits.

This automated cycle ensures that every commit is reviewed by AI before it even reaches the remote repository — enabling proactive quality control and faster feedback for developers.

### Features

- **Pre-commit Code Analysis**  
  Automatically analyzes code right after a local commit is made, ensuring issues are caught before pushing to the repository.

- **LLM-Based Multi-Agent Architecture**  
  Utilizes multiple specialized Language Model agents (Architect, Integration Analyst, SOLID Reviewer, Design Pattern Advisor, etc.) working in parallel for deep, context-aware code evaluation.

- **Support for Multiple LLM Providers**  
  Compatible with various LLM providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Ollama, Mistral, Groq, Cohere, and more) with plug-and-play extensibility via a factory pattern and reflection-based dynamic loading.

- **Automatic Report Generation**  
  Produces a detailed markdown report (`commit_analysis_report.md`) after each commit, summarizing architectural insights, design flaws, and suggestions.

- **No User Disruption**  
  Fully background operation – developers commit code as usual while CodeWise silently processes and reports.

- **Multi-language Project Support**  
  Can analyze projects written in multiple programming languages, especially those structured around standard architectural patterns (e.g., MVC, DDD).

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
  Designed to work on Windows, macOS, and Linux environments (as long as Node.js and VS Code are installed).

- **Modular and Extensible Design**  
  Easy to extend with new agent roles, models, or analysis types using a clean and maintainable architecture.

- **CI/CD Ready**  
  CodeWise is built to support packaging and publishing via GitHub Actions, enabling streamlined deployment of new versions.

### Requirements

* "@types/node": "20.x"

* "typescript": "^5.8.3"

* "node.js": "^v20.18.0"

* "npm": "^11.4.1"

* Visual Studio Code (v1.85+)

### Usage

Once installed and activated, CodeWise automatically monitors your Git workspace for new commits. When a commit is made, the extension triggers a background process that analyzes the committed code and generates a comprehensive report with architectural insights and improvement suggestions.

Follow these steps to use CodeWise:

1. **Open a Git-based project in VS Code.**  
   Ensure the project is tracked by Git and has at least one workspace folder opened.

2. **Make a commit.**  
   When you commit code, CodeWise detects the change and analyzes it automatically.

3. **Wait for the analysis.**  
   Within seconds, CodeWise runs a set of LLM agents to analyze your code based on architecture, integration, design patterns, SOLID principles, and framework usage.

4. **Check the output report.**  
   A new file named `commit_analysis_report.md` will be created in the root of your project, containing a detailed summary of findings and suggestions.

5. **Review and refactor.**  
   Open the report to review the suggestions. Use the insights to refactor and improve your code quality before pushing to remote repositories.

> The process is fully automated and non-intrusive. Developers commit code as usual; CodeWise works silently in the background.
