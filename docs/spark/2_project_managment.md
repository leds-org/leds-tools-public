| 8 | Generate code with AI based on use case comments | Use AI to analyze comments and automatically generate supporting code | 93 | Accelerate development with intelligent assistance |

## General planning

**Stopped development on creating OPA based on actor and use case events, without a link to C#.**

* Release 1.0 (14/10/2024 - 01/11/2024): Create authorization service rules based on Actor and User Case's Events on C# application and Create authorization data rules based on Actor and User Case`s Events  (Owner Patterns) on C#

## Release 1.0 - 01/11/2024

* **Goal**: Create authorization service and data based on User Case Diagram 

  * **Features**: ID 1 and ID 2

  * **Deadline I**  - 25/10/2024 
      * ID 1: Create authorization service rules based on Actor and User Case's Events on C# application  
  * **Deadline II** - 01/11/2024 
      * ID 2: Create authorization data rules based on Actor and User Case`s Events  (Owner Patterns) on C#
