0. (Prerequisite): Ensure that the Leds - Spark - Beta extension is installed in your VSCode editor. This extension is available through the editor's built-in extension marketplace. It is required to leverage Spark's features without the need to import libraries locally into your project. Note that it differs from the Spark - LEDS extension, which is also available in the same marketplace. Unlike the latter, Leds - Spark - Beta relies on an external library that unifies backend and frontend generation with a greater decoupling of responsibilities from Langium. The library, in turn, is responsible for decoupling business logic from the extension’s core repository, enabling reuse without compromising the main generation functionality.
